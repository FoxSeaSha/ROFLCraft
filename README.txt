ROFLCraft
-------------------------------------------

The ROFLCraft MOD is developed by Lorrtath, Keyman and Tyruss with the purpose of bringing RPG game elements into Minecraft.

This MOD has been built using the FORGE API, and should be loaded with the relevant FML procedure.

This mods development has been split into the following distinct phases:

    1) RPG
    2) Social
    3) Rouge
    4) Species
    5) Fey
    6) Magic
    n) Combat, powers & classes

RPG Phase[1] (Alpha V0.1)
==============================

The RPG phase of development allows for the core RPG element and roll systems. This will become the backbone of the entire MOD with all further phased building upon the core content here.

In terms of gameplay, this will mainly focus on Attributes, Stats & Skills. We have had discussions around combat, powers and classes. This will likely be done in parallel / spread across all the other phases as the various systems enable features.

This will be referred to as phase [n].

Social Phase[2] (Alpha V0.2)
==============================

The Social phase is designed to support in game character dialogue options, introduce speech / persuasion-based skills and overhaul trading. This will also include the addition of a purse and currency system.

This Social component will allow for "GMs" to create dialogue choice trees and script their own adventures. This will also support more advanced NPC creation / setup options; however, this will be further developed in one of the future phases.

Rouge Phase[3] (Alpha V0.3)
==============================

The Rouge phase will contain several features that afford players better stealth related skills and gameplay mechanics, such as locks, lockpicking, stealth checks, pick pocketing and associated combat & dialogue features.

Species Phase[4] (Alpha V0.4)
==============================

The purpose of the species phase is to allow for character and NPC diversity across more than human and villager/illager.

This phase will also likely contain an assortment of support features and items to facilitate other elements of gameplay.

Fey Phase[5] (Alpha V0.5)
==============================

The Fey phase will be an extension of the species and a pre-curser to the magic phase. It is yet to be decided if there will be a Fey realm, but conceptually this will aim to mimic the workings and species of the Fey realms found in Wizards D&D Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller chronicles.

Magic Phase[6] (Alpha V0.6)
==============================

Magic shall be the last phase of development, and potentially quite large. We are yet to define how it will work completely and while we have some ideas, as to how it will work, it is the lowest priority at the moment in terms of development and scoping.
